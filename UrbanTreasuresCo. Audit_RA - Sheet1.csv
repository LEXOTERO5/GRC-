AC-6,Least Privilege,"Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) that are necessary to accomplish assigned organizational tasks.","Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring that the processes have access to systems and operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational missions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems.","AC-2, AC-3, AC-5, AC-16, CM-5, CM-11, PL-2, PM-12, SA-8, SA-15, SA-17, SC-38",Interview ,"CISO, Sarah Mitchell

(a) [Assignment: organization-defined security functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware)]; and
(b) [Assignment: organization-defined security-relevant information].","Security functions include establishing system accounts; configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), configuring settings for events to be audited, and establishing intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes filtering rules for routers or firewalls, configuration parameters for security services, cryptographic key management information, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized personnel include security administrators, system administrators, system security officers, system programmers, and other privileged users.","AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, AU-9, PE-2",Interview ,"CISO, Sarah Mitchell

AC-6(2),Least Privilege | Non-privileged Access for Nonsecurity Functions,"Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to [Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information], use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.",Requiring use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity functions limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.,"AC-17, AC-18, AC-19, PL-4",Interview ,"CISO, Sarah Mitchell 
IT Manager, Jason Carter","We do not enforce the use of separate non-privileged 
accounts for admin users. 
Admins use their privileged accounts for both security-related 
and non-security functions, such as email or 
web browsing, as it simplifies their workflow. ",Not In Place ,Unauthorized Access,"Admin users performing non-security tasks (e.g., browsing, email) with privileged accounts expose sensitive systems to potential compromise through phishing, malware, or unintentional misuse.","Require privileged accounts to be used only on designated, hardened systems isolated from everyday tasks, such as separate virtual machines or physical devices.",8,10,80,This vulnerability significantly weakens the organization’s security posture and increases the likelihood of successful cyberattacks or internal misuse.

AC-6(4),Least Privilege | Separate Processing Domains,Provide separate processing domains to enable finer-grained allocation of user privileges.,"Providing separate processing domains for finer-grained allocation of user privileges includes using virtualization techniques to permit additional user privileges within a virtual machine while restricting privileges to other virtual machines or to the underlying physical machine; implementing separate physical domains, and employing hardware or software domain separation mechanisms.","AC-4, SC-2, SC-3, SC-30, SC-32, SC-39",Interview ,"CISO, Sarah Mitchell

AC-6(5),Least Privilege | Privileged Accounts,Restrict privileged accounts on the system to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles].,"Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from accessing privileged information or privileged functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided they retain the ability to control system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.","IA-2, MA-3, MA-4",Interview ,"CISO, Sarah Mitchell

Organizational users include contractors, guest researchers, or individuals detailed from other organizations. A non-organizational user is a user who is not an organizational user.

(b) Reassign or remove privileges, if necessary, to correctly reflect organizational mission and business needs.","The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time reflecting changes in organizational missions and business functions, environments of operation, technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.",CA-7,Interview ,"CISO, Sarah Mitchell 
IT Manager, Jason Carter","By using Azure AD Access Reviews and PIM, we ensure that user privileges are regularly evaluated and revoked when no longer necessary.

However, depending on the software functionality and configuration, if the privileges required for execution are at a higher level than the privileges assigned to organizational users invoking such applications or programs, those users may indirectly be provided with greater privileges than assigned.",,Interview ,"CISO, Sarah Mitchell

Remove admin rights from normal users unless explicitly required.,8,10,80,"Exploitation of admin privileges by malware, attackers, or accidental misuse is Very Likely, as admin rights are shared informally, and users can install software freely.  The absence of restrictions or controls makes this vulnerability Severe because there are no barriers preventing exploitation."
AC-6(9),Least Privilege | Log Use of Privileged Functions,Audit the execution of privileged functions.,"The misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Capturing the use of privileged functions in audit logs is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.","AU-2, AU-3, AU-12",Tested ,"CISO, Sarah Mitchell
